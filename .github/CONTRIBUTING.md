# Contributing to _______________

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

If you have a question or are experiencing a problem and need help please see [questions or problems](./QUESTIONS.md).

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase ( Via [Github Flow][github-flow] ). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your feature branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

We use [GitHub issues][github-issues] to track bugs and feature requests. Report a bug by [opening a new issue][github-issues].

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is a good stackoverflow example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

Also if you want more examples this [Angular Link][good-first-issues] will render Angular issues tagged with `good first issue`.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- A [MCVE (Minimal Complete Verifiable Example)][MCVE].  Ideally with a link to a [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/) or [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/) demo or an inline stackoverflow example.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Check if the project has `npm run format` and `npm run lint` scripts
